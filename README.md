# Aurelium 💎

> **⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL WEB FEATURES ⚠️**
> 
> *The newly added Web Dashboard features are currently in active development. Please expect potential bugs or instability if you enable `web.enabled` in your configuration. The core in-game economy, GUI markets, and auction house are mostly stable.*

**Aurelium** is a comprehensive, standalone economy plugin for Minecraft Paper.
> **Compatibility**: Paper, Purpur, Pufferfish, Leaves

It features a multi-currency system, a flexible Server Market with three interface modes (classic chest, modern styled, or browser-based web dashboard), a player-driven Auction House, Buy Orders, and seamless Vault integration.

## Features

### Web Dashboard (Optional)
Aurelium includes a modern, responsive web application that players can use to browse the Server Market, monitor stock trends, and engage with the Auction House from their browser.

* **Server Market:** Fully functional directly from the web—purchase items and have them delivered instantly in-game!![Web Market](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/b28a02ddb620b4a6b5bc54be95508d4adaabba29.png)
* **Auction House:** Fully interactive from the web—place bids and buyout items (BIN) securely. ![Web Auction House](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/d27ae421656ac26b76fbdc269d9ead39b93c471c.png)
* **Buy Orders:** Fully interactive from the web—fulfill player buy orders straight from your online inventory.![Web Buy Orders](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/709660b24ff769aaaf25b9f1c541577e372c7f6b.png)
* **Price Tracker:** An interactive chart tracking detailed item price histories. ![Web Chart](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/6a6c7c0a5e5a3371120a40242bc91baef67cb6ce.png) 
* **Live Sync:** Changes in-game reflect instantly on the web, and vice-versa. Click any item for an **interactive chart** with 7-day price history, smooth bezier curves, gradient fills, and hover tooltips.![Web Chart](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/101eff1a2a1ccb5f32ba6ffcc77c752f47dad4b3.png)
- **Price History**: Prices are recorded every 10 minutes and stored for 7 days for charts.
- **Cloud Mode**: Optional cloud hosting via Render for **almost** always-accessible dashboards.
- **Multi-Currency UI**: Correctly displays custom currency symbols (e.g., `₳`, `$`, `€`) synced perfectly from your `config.yml`.
- **Icon Fallbacks**: Robust image loading seamlessly falls back to older Minecraft versions  if modern icons aren't available from external APIs yet.
- **Secure Sessions**: Players use `/web` in-game to get a time-limited clickable link. Sessions use a rolling 1-hour timeout that resets on activity. Visiting the dashboard without a session shows a friendly error screen with instructions.
- **Tab Sleep Mode**: When a player switches to another browser tab or minimizes the window, the entire dashboard goes to sleep — no network requests, no CPU usage. When they return, it instantly wakes up and loads fresh data.
- **RAM Optimized**: Bulk data (auctions, orders, stocks, price history) is cached as raw JSON strings, keeping per-server memory usage under 1MB.
- **Activation Queue**: If the cloud server reaches its 500MB RAM limit, new server registrations are fairly waitlisted until memory frees up.
- **Configurable**: Port and enable/disable toggle in `config.yml`.

### Economy
- **Multi-Currency**: Define multiple currencies (e.g., Aurels ₳, Dollars $, Euros €) with unique symbols and starting balances.
- **Per-Item Currency**: Assign specific currencies to individual market items.
- **Vault Support**: Fully compatible with Vault-dependent plugins (ShopGUI+, Essentials, etc.).
- **Database**: SQLite or MySQL storage with automatic migration support.
- **Offline Earnings**: Get paid for auction sales even when you're offline.

### Custom Item Detection

Aurelium automatically discovers custom items from popular third-party plugins and makes them available in the server market -- no manual config required.

- **Auto-Scan on Startup**: The scanner runs once when the server starts, detecting all custom items from installed plugins.
- **Supported Plugins** (zero hard dependencies -- all via reflection):
  - ItemsAdder
  - Oraxen
  - MMOItems
  - MythicMobs
  - ExecutableItems
  - Nexo
  - SX-Item
- **`/customitems` Command**:
  - `/customitems scan` -- Force a rescan of all supported plugins
  - `/customitems list` -- View all discovered custom items
  - `/customitems info <id>` -- Show details for a specific item
  - `/customitems reload` -- Reload config overrides from disk
  - `/customitems toggle <id>` -- Enable or disable a discovered item in the market
  - `/customitems price <id> <buy> [sell]` -- Set buy/sell prices for a discovered item
- **Config Sync**: Discovered items are written to `config.yml` under `discovered-items:` with source plugin, display name, material, and default prices. Edits in config are loaded on startup or via `/customitems reload`.
- **Database Tracking**: Custom items are persisted in a `custom_items` table (schema v2, auto-migrates from v1).
- **Safe Fallbacks**: If no supported custom item plugins are installed, the scanner silently skips with zero overhead.

### Market
A server-owned shop that functions like a **Stock Market**, with **three interface modes**:
- **Classic**: Traditional chest-based inventory GUI.
- **Modern**: Styled chest GUI with MiniMessage gradient titles, glass-pane borders, and formatted lore.
- **Web**: A Modrinth-inspired browser dashboard (see Web Dashboard above).
- **Demand/Supply Logic**: Prices automatically rise when people buy (Demand) and fall when they sell (Supply). Both Buy and Sell values scale proportionally.
- **Anti-Exploit Safeguards**: Mathematically prevents the dynamic Sell price from ever exceeding the Buy price.
- **Live UI Updates**: The `/market` and `/stocks` menus automatically refresh every **1 second** natively while open.
- **Smart Pagination**: GUIs now feature **Page Indicator Books** in the center of the navigation bar, showing exactly what page you are on (e.g., "Page 1 of 5").
- **Searchable Menus**: Easily find any item in the Market or Auction House using the new **Compass** search button.
- **Market Crash Alerts**: Server-wide announcements when high-value items (Diamonds, Spawners, etc.) drop to bargain prices.
- **Performance Optimized**: 
 - **Viewer-Only Refresh**: Logic remains completely dormant unless a player has a menu open.
 - **Batched Disk I/O**: Transaction data is saved in backgrounds batches, preventing server "lag spikes" during high-volume trading.
 - **O(1) Data Access**: Market prices use ultra-fast local caching for near-zero CPU impact.
- **Smart Inventory Logistics**: Purchasing items securely fills your existing partial stacks instead of strictly demanding empty inventory slots.
- **Massive Catalog**: Includes **ALL Building Blocks** (Stones, Deepslate, Wood, Glass, Nature, etc.) and over **60+ Mob Spawners**. 

### Auction
A fully self-contained player-driven exchange:
- **100% GUI Driven**: Complex chat commands are a thing of the past. You can effortlessly **Sell Items**, **Place Custom Bids**, and **Make Private Offers** directly via intuitive chat-prompt buttons inside the menus.
- **Safety Confirmations**: Never accidentally bankrupt yourself again. Both *Buy It Now* and *Bidding* feature a dedicated **Confirmation Screen** before deducting funds.
- **Manage Offers**: Sellers can view all incoming deals in `/ah offers` and instantly **Accept (✔)** or **Decline (✖)**.
- **Live Updates**: The GUI **instantly refreshes** for all players when an item is bought, bidded on, or cancelled. Additionally, **auction timers update in real-time** every second while the menu is open.
- **Auto-Refunds**: Placed a bid and got outbid? Your money is **instantly returned** to your balance.
- **Pro-Tip**: Almost every command below (like `/ah search`, `/sell`, and `/ah offer`) can also be triggered by simply **clicking the intuitive buttons** (Compass, Emerald, or Books) directly inside the GUIs!

### Buy Orders
A global request system that lets players buy things they want even while offline:
- **Global Requests**: Request any item in the game (including all 120+ Enchanted Books and Ingots) at your specific custom price.
- **Automated Fulfillment**: Other players can browse active orders and fulfill them instantly directly from their inventory.
- **Escrow System**: Money is held safely in escrow. If you cancel an order, your unspent funds are instantly returned.
- **Offline Collections**: Items fulfilled while you are offline are safely put into your Auction House `/ah collect` bin. You'll be notified on login!
- **Buyer Notifications**: Get notified in real-time when someone fills your order, or on your next login if you were offline.
- **Intelligent Searching**: The `/orders` GUI features dynamic search buttons (Compass and Sign icons) allowing you to filter specific categories or search the entire Minecraft catalog for any valid item.

### Market Stabilization
- **Price Floor & Ceiling**: Prices can never crash below 20% or inflate above 500% of the original base value (both configurable).
- **Natural Recovery**: Prices passively drift back toward their base value every 10 minutes, preventing permanent crashes from auto-farms.

### Stocks
- **Real-time Tracking**: View the incredibly accurate *Current Buy Price* and *Current Sell Price* of every item in the market.
- **Trends**:
 - **Green (▲ +%)**: Demand is peaking.
 - **Red (▼ -%)**: Market is oversaturated.

## Setup

1. Download `Aurelium-1.4.5.jar`.
2. Place it in your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. **Restart** the server.
 - *Note: If Vault is not detected, Aurelium will automatically extract and install it into your plugins folder for you upon first run.*

## Config

### Items
Control every price directly in the config:

```yaml
market-items:
 DIAMOND:
 buy: 5000.0 # Cost to buy from server
 sell: 0.0 # 0.0 = Selling DISABLED
 DIRT:
 buy: 1.0
 sell: 0.5 # Players can sell dirt for 0.5
 BEDROCK:
 buy: -1.0 # -1.0 = Buying DISABLED
```

### Network Syncing (MySQL Required)
Aurelium supports cross-server synchronization for **BungeeCord** and **Velocity** networks. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MySQL IS REQUIRED** for synchronization. SQLite does not support cross-server data sharing.

By pointing all your backend servers (e.g., Survival, Skyblock) to the **same MySQL database** in their `config.yml`, the following data will be shared instantly:
* **Global Balances**: Player balances are refreshed on join, ensuring they carry their money across your entire network.
* **Global Auction House**: All active auctions and the collection bin are shared across all linked servers.
* **Per-Server Markets**: Currently, dynamic Market prices are stored in each server's local `config.yml`. This allows you to have different economies (e.g., a "Hardcore" survival market vs. a "Creative" skyblock market) while players keep the same wallet.

### Language
A `messages.yml` file is generated on startup.
- **Translate**: Change any message to your language.
- **Color Codes**: Use MiniMessage formatting (e.g., `<green>`) or legacy `&` codes.

## FAQ
- **"Unknown Command"**: If `/market` or `/eco` says "Unknown command", the plugin failed to load.
 - Check your server console/logs for errors.
 - Ensure you have `Aurelium-1.4.5.jar` in `plugins/`.
 - Ensure you are running **Paper** (or compatible forks: Purpur, Pufferfish, Leaves).
- **"No Permission"**:
 - Ensure you are **OP** (`/op <player>`) or have the permission node `aureleconomy.admin`.
 - Note: Standard player commands (`/bal`, `/market`, `/ah`, `/sell`) are enabled for everyone by default.
- **Still not working?**
 - If none of the above fixes your issue, please [open an issue](https://github.com/APPLEPIE6969/Aurelium/issues) on GitHub with your server version, error logs, and steps to reproduce.
